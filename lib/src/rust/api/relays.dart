/// * `pubkey` - The public key of the account whose relays to fetch

/// * `Ok(Vec<RelayUrl>)` - Vector of relay URLs for the specified type

/// * `pubkey` - The public key of the account whose key package to fetch

/// * `Ok(Some(Event))` - The key package event if found
/// * `Ok(None)` - If no key package was found on the relays
/// * `Err(WhitenoiseError)` - If there was an error fetching the key package

/// * This function automatically uses the account's configured key package relays

/// specified account. This is useful for monitoring relay connectivity and
/// diagnosing connection issues. Both relay URLs and statuses are converted
/// to string format for Flutter compatibility.
///
/// # Parameters
/// * `pubkey` - The public key of the account whose relay statuses to check
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(Vec<(String, String)>)` - Vector of tuples containing each relay URL as a string and its current status as a string
/// * `Err(WhitenoiseError)` - If there was an error fetching relay statuses or account not found
///
/// # Notes
/// * The status reflects the current connection state at the time of the call
/// * Relay statuses can change frequently due to network conditions
/// * This function checks all relay types configured for the account
/// * Possible status values include: "Initialized", "Pending", "Connecting", "Connected", "Disconnected", "Terminated", "Banned", "Sleeping"

/// ```rust
/// let statuses = fetch_relay_status(pubkey).await?;
/// for (url, status) in statuses {
///     println!("Relay {} is {}", url, status);
